<em class="alert">(a)</em> For <span class="process-math">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {(-1)^n\over 3^n}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} {1\over 3^n} =
0\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, by the alternating series test, we know that this series converges (it is at least conditionally convergent).  Because <span class="process-math">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {1\over 3^n}\)</span> also converges (by comparison to a <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-series or by the integral test), our original series must be not only conditionally convergent but absolutely convergent. <em class="alert">(b)</em> For <span class="process-math">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {(-1)^n\left({n+1\over n}\right)}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} {n+1\over n} =
1\text{.}\)</span>  This means that the alternating series test doesn't tell us whether this series converges: if the limit had been zero, we would know that the series converged, but if it's non-zero the test doesn't help.  However, note that <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left({n+1\over n}\right) = 1 \ne 0\text{.}\)</span>  Thus <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} (-1)^n\left({n+1\over n}\right)\)</span> doesn't exist, and we know that the series must in fact diverge.</div></body>
