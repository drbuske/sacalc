<li><p>This recursive sequence is bounded between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(30\text{,}\)</span> and since each term is half the previous one, it is monotone decreasing. The sequence converges to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>

<li><p>This sequence is not monotone, since it alternates between positive and negative terms. It is bounded between <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (also between <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>).
