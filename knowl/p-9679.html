<p>Up to this point, we have been representing a graph by a single equation involving two variables such as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> However, some graphs are not well described by such equations. In this section, we study situations in which it is useful to introduce a third variable called a <dfn class="terminology">parameter</dfn> to represent a curve in the plane. For example, if the parameter is <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> (a common choice), then <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> might represent time.  Then <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are defined as functions of time, and <span class="process-math">\((x(t),y(t))\)</span> can describe the position in the plane of a given object as it moves along a curved path.  This process is commonly called <dfn class="terminology">parameterization</dfn> and is the basis for our study of parametric curves.</p>
