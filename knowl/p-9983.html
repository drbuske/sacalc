<p>The rectangular coordinate system can be thought of as a means to provide directions to a particular location in the plane.  From a "home" position (the origin), if we walked <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> unit right and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> units down to reach a location <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> we would denote such directions by the ordered pair <span class="process-math">\((1,-\sqrt{3})\)</span> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/polarcoordsintro.html" title="Figure 9.3.1">FigureÂ 9.3.1</a>).  But there are other ways we could describe how to reach point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> from the origin.  If we are standing at the origin facing to the right (in the direction of the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis), we could reach <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> by turning our body <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{3}\)</span> radians clockwise and walking <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> units forward.  Such directions could be represented by the ordered pair <span class="process-math">\(\left( 2,-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\text{.}\)</span>  We use a negative sign for the angle of rotation since counterclockwise is normally treated positively in mathematics.  These ordered pairs, or directions, are the polar coordinates we study in this section.</p>
