<p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>To determine which graphed function is the the derivative of another, we use the fact that the derivative is zero where the original function has a maximum or minimum.  We note that A has zeros where C has a maximum or minimum, so it could be the derivative, so we can have <span class="process-math">\(A = C'\text{.}\)</span> In addition, C has zeros where B has a maximum or minimum, so that it is possible that <span class="process-math">\(C = B'\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To confirm this, we compare intervals where C is increasing and decreasing and verify that these are where A is positive and negative, respectively, and similarly compare B and C.</p>
<p>This gives us that <span class="process-math">\(f = B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f' = C\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'' = A\text{.}\)</span></p>
