<li><p>We can use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis by either (i) taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution which will then be circular disks or washers or (ii) taking slices parallel to the axis of revolution which will then be thin shells.</p></li>
<li><p>If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line (e.g. apply the disk or washer method), then our slices are horizontal and of thickness <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\text{.}\)</span> This leads us to integrate with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> as opposed to with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> when we slice a solid rotated about a horizontal line vertically.  If we revolve about a vertical line and slice parallel to that line (e.g. apply the shell method), then our slices are vertical and of thickness <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\text{.}\)</span>  This leads us to integrate with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If we revolve about a line other than the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>- or <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice. Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.</p></li>
<li><p>A definite integral may be used to represent the volume of a solid. The idea is to slice the solid into thin shapes whose volume is easy to calculate. The volume of each slice is found by taking the area of the cross-section and multiplying it by the width. Summing up the volumes of the slices and taking the limit as the width approaches zero results in an integral representing the volume.</p></li>
